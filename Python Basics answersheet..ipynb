        "**Theoritical Question:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question no 1: what is python and why it is popular?:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that's widely used for creating programmas which constists of several instruction for a computer to follow, or in other words python is a programming language which helps to buidl set of rules and symbols that define the process of writing and computer programms.\n",
        "It is very popular because it is easy to learn, begginer friendly, it is versatile. it have a lot of libraries, and a huge community.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question no. 2. What is an interpreter in python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** An interpreter is a program that reads and executes python code line by line converting the code into machine language so that machine/computer can understand and operates accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question no. 3. What are pre-defined keywords in python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Predefined keywords are the words that have special meaning in the language, they can't be used as variables or identifiers because they are the part of syntax.\n",
        "for example: if, True, False, print(), for, while, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question no. 4. Can keywords be used as varaible names?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** No, keywords can't be used as variable, because they are reserved for specific functions and if we use them as variable name the execution will show error.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question no. 5. What is mutability in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Objects/Containers whose state or value can be changed after they are created are called a mutable objects/Container.\n",
        "List is a type of mututabl e object, which means we can do rectification in a list once the list is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question no. 6. Why lists are mutable but tuples are immutable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**In a list we can make changes, add, or remove elements after the list are created as they are designed to hold the dynamic collection of items/data, whereas we are not able to make changes, add or remove an element once the tuple is created as they are designed to hold a fixed collection of items/data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question no. 7. What is the difference be \"==\" and \"is\" in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** \"==\" stands for equality operator, it checks if the valuesv are equal. it also works if the objects are stored at different location, wvhereas \"is\" stands for identiy operator, it checks if two or more variable points to the exact same object in the memory.\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "a=(1,2,3)\n",
        "b=(1,2,3)\n",
        "we can say a==b, because both the varibles have equal value which are stored at different memory location.\n",
        "but a=c=5 we can say a is c as both have same value and stored at a same location.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question no. 8. What are logical operators in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** The logical operators are used to combine multiple conditionvvs and return the results. There are three logical operators in python and, or and not. They are often used in if statements, loops etc."

        "\n",
        "for example: a = \"2\", here the data type of \"a\" is str, but we can change this data type by using int(a) it will change the string data type into interger 2 or float(a) it will change the string data type into float 2.0.\n",
